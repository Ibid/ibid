.TH IBID-PLUGIN "1" "January 2010" "Ibid 0.0" "Multi-protocol Chat Bot"
.SH NAME
ibid-plugin \- Plugin testing developer environment for Ibid (the multi-protocol chat bot)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ibid-plugin
.RI [ options ...]
.RI [ plugin\fR[\fB- ]| plugin\fB.\fIProcessor [\fB-\fR]...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This utility is for testing Ibid plugins without the full bot
environment.
This means testing can be performed offline and without loading all the
available plugins.
.P
This should be run in a configured Ibid bot directory.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-configured\fR
Load all configured plugins, instead of only the core and requested
plugins.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-only\fR
Don't load the Ibid core plugins, only the plugins requested.
Note that without the \fBcore\fR plugin to pre- and post-process events,
most other plugins won't function correctly.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-public\fR
By default, \fBibid-plugin\fR emulates a private conversation with the
bot.
With this option, the conversation is considered to be public.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show a help message and exit.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I ibid.ini
Locates the database to act upon by looking for the \fB[databases].ibid\fR value
in the bot configuration file in the current directory.
