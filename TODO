Decisions
=========
Presence event naming (joined/parted? online/offline?)
Config object
Auto-load plugins
Memo: Leaving memos for people without identities
Factpacks: Fixed high factoid_ids? Mark in database
Private attributes
Deleting factoids: confirmation?, marking as deleted
Better meaning for "Ibid"
Better names for event.{sender,sender_id,who}

To Do
=====
Identity recognition for Jabber MUC
Jabber vCard
Refactor Reloader class
Console source
Improve NickServ authentication
Race condition where two identities are created if multiple messages received at the same time (usually from services/bots)
    - Can't happen anymore due to unique constraint, but second message won't be handled properly because no identity will be attached
SMTP source: Handle multiple queries in a single message
Accounts: Modify/delete accounts
Accounts: Admin command to create an account and attach an identity?
Single declarative_base()
Tests for everything
Base: Handle arbitrary bases.
Memo: Delete old memos.
Feeds: Caching
Feeds: Check URL when added
setup.py: Exclude most of lib/
PB: Logging, identifying
Introspection
Memo table: s/frm/from/
