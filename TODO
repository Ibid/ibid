Decisions
=========
Auto-load plugins
Memo: Leaving memos for people without identities
Factpacks: Fixed high factoid_ids? Mark in database
Private attributes
Better meaning for "Ibid"
Better names for event.{sender,sender_id,who}
Database string limits

To Do

    - Can't happen anymore due to unique constraint, but second message won't be handled properly because no identity will be attached
Accounts: Modify/delete accounts
Accounts: Admin command to create an account and attach an identity?
Base: Handle arbitrary bases.
Memo: Delete old memos.
setup.py: Exclude most of lib/
PB: Logging, identifying
