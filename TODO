Factpacks: Fixed high factoid_ids? Mark in database
Private attributes
Better meaning for "Ibid"
Better names for event.{sender,sender_id,who}
Database string limits

To Do
=====
Identity recognition for Jabber MUC
Jabber vCard
Refactor Reloader class
Console source
Improve NickServ authentication
Race condition where two identities are created if multiple messages received at the same time (usually from services/bots)
    - Can't happen anymore due to unique constraint, but second message won't be handled properly because no identity will be attached
SMTP source: Handle multiple queries in a single message
Accounts: Modify/delete accounts
Accounts: Admin command to create an account and attach an identity?
Single declarative_base()
Tests for everything
Base: Handle arbitrary bases.
Memo: Delete old memos.
Feeds: Caching
Feeds: Check URL when added
setup.py: Exclude most of lib/
PB: Logging, identifying
Introspection
Import: wei√ües fleisch
die command
Buildbot: Access build information
apt syntax
Factoids: modify
RPC authentication
