Configuration
=============

.. _botdir:

The botdir
----------

Every Ibid lives in a directory, the botdir.
This holds the configuration file, logs, caches, the SQLite database if
you are using it, and plugins you've written.

The botdir should be your current directory whenever you run an
ibid-related script, so it can find the configuration file.

All non-absolute paths in the ibid configuration are relative to the
botdir.

.. note::
   The botdir is added to the front of :attr:`sys.path`, so any python
   package that you put in the botdir will be available to the bot, and
   take precedence over other versions of the same package.

The configuration file
----------------------

Ibid's configuration is stored in ``ibid.ini``, created when you
install Ibid.
You can edit it at any time and tell the bot to ``reread config`` or
edit it online with the *config* feature.

A simple example ibid.ini::

   botname = joebot
   logging = logging.ini

   [auth]
       methods = password,
       timeout = 300
       permissions = +factoid, +karma, +sendmemo, +recvmemo, +feeds, +publicresponse

   [sources]
       [[telnet]]
       [[timer]]
       [[http]]
           url = http://joebot.example.com
       [[smtp]]
       [[pb]]
       [[atrum]]
           channels = "#ibid",
           nick = $botname
           type = irc
           auth = hostmask, nickserv
           server = irc.atrum.org

   [plugins]
       cachedir = /tmp/ibid
       [[core]]
           names = $botname, bot, ant
           ignore = ,

   [databases]
       ibid = sqlite:///ibid.db

This shows the main sections of the file.
It is in configobj format, an ini-variant with nested sections.
Whitespace is ignored, all values belong to the most recently defined
section.

Lines can be commented out by prefixing them with ``#``.

Top Level Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. describe:: botname:

   String: The name of the bot.
   It will respond to this name.

.. describe:: logging:

   String: The location of the :mod:`logging` configuration file.

   Default: ``logging.ini``

.. describe:: mysql_engine:

   String: The engine that MySQL tables will be created in.

   Default: ``InnoDB``

Auth
^^^^

This section is for configuring Ibid's user-authentication.
Permissions that are granted ``â€¦when authed`` require users to
authenticate themselves to the bot before the permission can be invoked.
Some sources have special ways of authenticating users (e.g. the
``nickserv`` authentication method on IRC) or guarantee that their users
are always authenticated via the ``imlicit`` authentication method (e.g.
jabber).

.. describe:: methods:

   List: Authentication methods that can be used on all sources.

.. describe:: timeout:

   Number: Time in seconds that authentication should be cached for
   before requiring re-authentication.

.. describe:: permissions:

   List: Permissions that are granted to everyone.
   Although they can be overridden for specific users, using the online
   grant function.

   The name of the permission can be prefixed with a ``+`` to indicate
   that this permission is granted without requiring authentication.
   Or a ``-`` to revoke a permission granted to all users of a source.

   See :ref:`the list of permissions <permissions>`.

Sources
^^^^^^^

Sources are the way that Ibid connects to users.
Every IRC/SILC/DC server is it's own source as are connections to other
services.

The configuration parameters that applies to all sources are:

.. describe:: disabled:

   Boolean: Every source can be disabled from auto-starting by setting
   this to ``True`` in the source`s configuration.

.. describe:: type:

   String: The driver that this source should use.
   This allows you to have more than one IRC source, for example.

   Default: The name of the source.

.. describe:: permissions:

   List: This lets you grant and revoke permissions to all users on the
   source.
   They can be overridden for specific users, using the online grant
   function.

   The name of the permission can be prefixed with a ``+`` to indicate
   that this permission is granted without requiring authentication.
   Or a ``-`` to revoke a permission granted to all users of a source.

   See :ref:`the list of permissions <permissions>`.

IRC Source
""""""""""

.. describe:: server:

   **Reqired**
   String: The hostname of the IRC server to connect to.

   Ibid `does not currently support
   <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/363466>`_ falling back to alternate
   servers, so you may want to use a round-robin hostname.

.. describe:: port:

   Number: The port to connect to.

   Default: ``6667``

.. describe:: ssl:

   Boolean: Use SSL-encrypted connection to the server.

   Default: ``False``

.. describe:: nick:

   String: The nickname for the bot to use on this server.

   Default: The :obj:`botname`

.. describe:: modes:

   String: The IRC modes to set.
   Some servers require bots to set mode ``B``.

   Default: nothing

.. describe:: channels:

   List: Channels to join on connection to the server.

   .. warning::
      You must include the leading ``#``, but unless you quote each
      channel, Ibid will see the rest of the config line as a comment.

      So use quotes around each channel name like this: ``"#ibid",
      "#fun"``

.. describe:: ping_interval:

   Number: How many seconds in between each keep-alive PING sent to the
   server.

   Default: ``60``

.. describe:: pong_timeout:

   Number: How long to wait for PONGs before giving up and reconnecting.

   Default: ``300``
