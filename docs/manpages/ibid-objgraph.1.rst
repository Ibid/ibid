SYNOPSIS
========

| ``ibid-objgraph`` [*options*...] *logfile* *type*...
| ``ibid-objgraph`` [*options*...] ``-e`` *TIME* *logfile*
| ``ibid-objgraph`` ``-h``

DESCRIPTION
===========

This utility is for graphing object-type usage from an Ibid bot
configured to log such usage.

Matplotlib is required for graphing.

OPTIONS
=======

-e TIME, --examine=TIME
   Examine the object usage at time *TIME*, and print a sorted list of
   type statistics at that time.
   This function can be useful in determining which types to graph, when
   chasing down a detected leak.

-o FILE, --output=FILE
   Output to *FILE* instead of displaying interactive graph GUI.
   *FILE* can be any format supported by Matplotlib, detected by the
   file extension.

-d DPI, --dpi=DPI
   When outputting in raster formats, use *DPI* output DPI.

-h, --help
   Show a help message and exit.

FILES
=====

*logfile*
   A log file generated by loading the **memory** plugin into Ibid,
   which will periodically log object usage.
   It can be gzip compressed, if the filename ends in ``.gz``.
