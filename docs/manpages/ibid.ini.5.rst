NAME

DESCRIPTION
===========

``ibid.ini`` contains all the configuration for an Ibid bot.

A complete description of the contents of this file is out of the scope
of this manpage.
For more details see the Ibid HTML documentation:
http://ibid.omnia.za.net/docs/

Lines beginning with ``#`` are considered to be comments and ignored.
To use a ``#`` symbol in an option (e.g. an IRC channel name), quote the
option with double-quotes, e.g. ``channels = "#ibid",``

This file will be written to by the bot when configuration settings are
altered online.
It can also be edited manually and a running bot told to
``reload config``.
Manual edits and comments will be preserved when the bot modifies its
own configuration, provided that they have not been edited since bot
start-up or the last config reload.

SECTIONS
========

auth
----

Settings related to permissions and authentication.
Permissions listed in **auth**.\ **permissions** are granted to all
users unless revoked by source or account.

sources
-------

Sources are Ibid connections to an IM service.
They range from IRC networks to the bot's built-in HTTP server.

Each source is configured in a section named after the source.
The source name will define the driver that the source should use,
unless a ``type`` option is provided.

Sources can be disabled by setting
``disabled = True``.

plugins
-------

Plugin configuration.
Each plugin is configured within a section named after the plugin.

cachedir
   The directory that temporary files (such as downloaded data), useful
   to be the bot but expendable, is stored in.

autoload
   If ``True``, all plugins not explicitly ignored will be loaded.
   (Note that some plugins mark themselves as non-auto-loadable).
   Defaults to ``True``.

load
   The list of plugins (or **plugin**.\ **Processor**\ s) to load.

noload
   The list of plugins (or **plugin**.\ **Processor**\ s) to ignore and
   not load.

core.names
   The names that the bot should respond to.

core.ignore
   Nicks that the bot should completely ignore (e.g. other bots).
