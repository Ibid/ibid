SYNOPSIS
========

``ibid-plugin`` [*options*...] [*plugin*\ [``-``]|\ *plugin*\ ``.``\ *Processor*\ [``-``]...]

DESCRIPTION
===========

This utility is for testing Ibid plugins without the full bot
environment.  This means testing can be performed offline and without
loading all the available plugins.

This should be run in a configured Ibid bot directory.

All the listed plugins and Processors will be loaded on start-up.
Naming a plugin loads the complete plugin.
Suffixing a ``-`` to the name, ignores that plugin or Processor instead
of loading it.

OPTIONS
=======

-c, --configured
   Load all configured plugins, instead of only the core and requested
   plugins.

-o, --only
   Don't load the Ibid core plugins, only the plugins requested.
   Note that without the **core** plugin to pre- and post-process
   events, most other plugins won't function correctly.

-p, --public
   By default, **ibid-plugin** emulates a private conversation with the
   bot.
   With this option, the conversation is considered to be public and the
   bot will have to be addressed to provoke a response.

-v, --verbose
   Increase verbosity.
   The final form of each *Event* object will be displayed before any
   responses.

-h, --help
   Show a help message and exit.

FILES
=====

ibid.ini
   Locates the database to act upon by looking for the
   [**databases**].\ **ibid** value in the bot configuration file in the
   current directory.

BUGS
====

**ibid-plugin** doesn't emulate a complete Ibid environment, and will
ignore all of the following:

 * Delayed and periodically executed functions.
 * Messages to alternate sources.
 * Messages directly dispatched, rather than added to responses.
 * Permissions. All permissions are granted to the user.
