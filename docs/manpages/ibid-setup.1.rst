SYNOPSIS
========

**ibid-setup**

DESCRIPTION
===========

This program sets up everything that a new Ibid bot needs before it can run.
It asks a series of questions about the new bot, and writes out a basic
configuration file - ``ibid.ini``\ (5) - to the current directory.
It also creates a database for the bot, by default a SQLite database in
the current directory.

This should be run in the directory which will become the new Ibid bot's
base.

Should there be an existing ``ibid.ini`` in the current directory, it
will be used, and the only questions asked will be for adding an
administrative user.
These can safely be skipped with a ``^C``.

FILES
=====

ibid.ini
   The Ibid bot's configuration file, will be created if it doesn't exist.
