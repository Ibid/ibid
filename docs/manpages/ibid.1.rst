SYNOPSIS
========

``ibid`` [*config-file*]

DESCRIPTION
===========

This runs an Ibid bot in the foreground.

There should there be an existing ``ibid.ini`` (created by
``ibid-setup``\ (1))
in the current directory or one should be provided on the command line.

Where possible, you should run ``twistd -n ibid`` instead of this
program, as otherwise some classes of errors go unreported.
See **BUGS**.

BUGS
====

Exceptions in twisted callbacks can go unnoticed in this program.
That has no harmful effects, but the developers may miss out on some
good bug reports.

FILES
=====

*ibid.ini*
   The Ibid bot's configuration file, will be created if it doesn't exist.
